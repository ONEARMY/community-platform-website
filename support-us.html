            <div class="text-block-5">The entire land was fully burned down in 2017, destroying a big part of the native trees. Now whats is growing back is basically 1 species, mimosas. A non native invasive tree that grows fast and takes the sunlight for other plants. This makes it in the long term very hard to create a healthy diverse forrest life and will have much higher changes for wild fires again in the future. Forrest fires are a big challenge in Portugal but we can help to prevent them. We will work with ecologists to analyse the land, create a landscape plan, clean the current land and start planting a strong forrest. For years to come.<br><br>⭐️ Reward: Offset your footprint, we name the the forrest after you</div>

            <div class="text-block-5">Running 100% on renewable energy is a long term goal for us. Easy to achieve for a small household, difficult to achieve with 380V machines like welding and a metal lathe. Is requires a big battery pack, solar panels and a backup like hydro/wind energy for the days without sun. It’s mainly a long term goal because it would take us a while before we have the funds. You can speed this up by providing the capital or sponsoring it.<br><br>⭐️ Reward: We will mention your name/help/company in our videos</div>
